## Support Script

If user asks: *"Why do I need to tap a button?"*

**Response:**
> "On iOS, this is normal for web apps! Apple requires apps to be installed from Safari. Once installed, email links work great - just one quick tap and you're signed in. This is the same experience as Twitter, LinkedIn, and other major web apps on iPhone."
